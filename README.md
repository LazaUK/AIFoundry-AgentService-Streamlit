# Azure AI Foundry: Agent Service - UI Demo Kit

[Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) is a powerful offering within Azure AI Foundry that allows you to develop intelligent AI agents. AI agents can be customised to answer questions, perform autonomous sets of tasks and interact with users naturally and intuitively.

This repo contains the source code for a Streamlit-based UI Demo Kit showcasing various capabilities of the Agent Service, including:
- Solving complex problems with the `Code Interpreter` (which builds and runs sandboxed Python code);
- Grounding model outputs (completions) with real-time `Bing Search` results;
- with more to come...

> [!NOTE]
> The Streamlit app can be run locally on your computer and requires access to AI models deployed in Azure AI Foundry. Alternatively, you can deploy a pre-built app using the provided Docker image.

## Part 1: Configuring solution environment
1. Copy the connection string from your AI Foundry Project settings, as shown in the image below:
![config_foundry_conn_string](images/foundry_conn_string.png)
2. Set the environment variable for the copied Project connection string:
    - _Windows_: Add **AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_CONNSTRING** as a system variable with the copied string as its value;
    - _macOS/Linux_: Set the variable in your terminal:
      ``` bash
      export AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_CONNSTRING="your_connection_string"
      ```
3. Add other environment variables to enable specific UI Demo Kit capabilities:

| Environment Variable | Description | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ```AZURE_FOUNDRY_GPT_MODEL``` | Deployment name of the **_Azure OpenAI_** GPT model | * |
| ```AZURE_FOUNDRY_BING_SEARCH``` | Connection name of the **_Bing Search_** resource | Grounding with Bing Search |

4. Install the required Python packages using the **pip** command and the provided requirements.txt file:
``` PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> Local installation utilises the _DefaultAzureCredential_ class. Depending on your environment, the UI Demo Kit will search for available Azure identities in the order described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python).

## Part 2: Web app - User Guide
1. To launch the web app, run the following command from the root folder of this repo:
``` PowerShell
streamlit run AgentService_Streamlit_v1.py
```
2. If everything was installed correctly as per Part 1's instructions, you should be able to access the demo solution's web page locally at http://localhost:8501.

3. The UX is intentionally minimalistic. Here's how to use it:
    * **_Choose a Capability_**: Begin by choosing the desired capability from the left-side navigation panel.
    * **_Enter Your Prompt_**: Each scenario comes with a default prompt. You can modify it in the provided text area.
    * **_Run the Agent_**: Click the "Run" button. The underlying Agent Service will utilise relevant tools, with the run status reflected in the progress bar.
    * **_View the Output_**: Depending on the selected scenario, the UI Demo Kit may produce its output in text, code and image formats.

> [!NOTE]
> As a Generative AI solution, the Agent Service is inherently non-deterministic. Therefore, itâ€™s normal to receive slightly different outputs in the UI Demo Kit for the same prompts.

## Part 3: Web app - Docker image option
This repo includes a companion Docker image on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), which contains a pre-built web app with all dependencies. It allows you to launch the UI Demo Kit as a container without getting deep into its code's specifics.

There are two ways to utilise the provided Docker image:

### a) Using the Docker image "as is":
1. First, you download the image from GHCR and verify that it's accessible:
``` PowerShell
docker pull ghcr.io/lazauk/uidemokit:latest
```
2. Then you launch it on your local machine and pass the values of 3 expected environment variables, described in Part 1 above. If these variables are already set on your host machine, their values will be automatically picked up by the container, when using this command:
``` PowerShell
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env AZURE_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_CONNSTRING --env AZURE_FOUNDRY_GPT_MODEL --env AZURE_FOUNDRY_BING_SEARCH ghcr.io/lazauk/uidemokit:latest
```

### b) Using the Docker image as a base for your custom one:
1. If you prefer to customise the web app, you can use the provided Docker image as a base for your own Dockerfile:
``` PowerShell
FROM ghcr.io/lazauk/uidemokit:latest
```
2. The **AgentService_Streamlit_v1.py** file is located in the /app working directory of the container.
